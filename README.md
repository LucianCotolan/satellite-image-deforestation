# Satellite Image Classification for detecting Deforestation in Romania using SAS Viya Programming and Python

[Train/Validation Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/199zqlL_K3ZQWuyrPxdoB_KsKi7-pIG1j/view?usp=share_link) -- This is the modified dataset that we created for our image classification problem. The dataset contains the training images from [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data) on Kaggle, but the classes are now binary: deforestification, non_deforestification

[Test Dataset](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) -- The second dataset, serving as the validation set, was collected from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission which provides information about the changes in land cover and worldâ€™s forests. We used product type S2MSI2A which has atmospheric correction applied and collected four tiles (T34TFR, T35TLL, T35TLN, T34TFS) marking four regions of interest from Romanian Carpathians: Eastern, Southern and Western, which were identified as having massive deforestation. Only the bands B04, B03, B02 equivalent to RGB were extracted. [Download Test Sentinel 2 data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXPeBy-r31qJI60R7DSnFHxqrdRZFE6b/view?usp=sharing)
